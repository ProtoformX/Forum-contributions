Frenzy
{what about Frenzy? in a competitive enviroment Frenzied units are almost useless due to chaff units and frenzy rule that force them to overrun/pursue....what about allowing a Leadership Test (with a penalty like -3??) to restrain from pursuing/overrunning? it's not easy but you can pass that test and so make good use of that frenzied unit.
in 8th against a not so skilled opponent a frenzied unit will only get chaff units and go in wrong directions/against impassable....or in some case show their flank to a charge.}

What about, for frenzy or in general, when overrunning/chasing you can make a leadership test to stop, and
increase leadership by the points you won combat by.

Or when rolling for leadership test, reduce your roll by the points you won by.

{If you'd like to see Mark of Khorne more viable then I think you'd need to look at alternate rules other than frenzy to represent them, perhaps moving away from crazy blokes with big axes and concentrating more on the god of war aspect, hatred or +1 strength on the charge would probably be a better rules for them backed up with ITP.}

That idea could also work with other non chaos frenzy. But I think keeping frenzy and modifying it slightly is a better option. Maybe buffing it if you continue to keep it at “must charge if possible”
Also, when frenzied, add to attack and leadership values instead of just attacks. When you lose frenzy, also lose from initiative value.



{Army selection: 35% characters, 50% of that may be spent on lords.}
That’s too complex, I know it’s only one rule here and now but as part of a whole armybook and core rules it’s too much. For everyone who wants the restriction on lords like that, I like this idea.
20% max on lords
50% max on heroes
50% min on core
50% max on special
20% max on rare

it needs playtesting, but it forces people to use their core choices. If people avoid using their core units because of their options, that tells me there is a problem with each specific army book. Core choices are the core choice in an army after all.




{All mounts work like MC, including monsters. If you wanted to keep them inline with the endtimes characters then combine the wounds I guess. Just solves so many issues with characters and mounts. Remove challenges, they don't perform the function they are meant to (and no, I don't own any dragons in any army)
BSB may not be used for psychology tests.}

I actually like all of that

{Fear tests failed should be -1 to hit, if you outnumber them then the test is taken at -1. If you then lose combat after failing a fear test your leadership test is at -1, -2 if they outnumber you.}
You can still hit at WS 1. but I agree it might be too painful. I think a simply -1 to hit is too forgiving though.
Maybe a middle ground of -2?
As of the 7th and 8th edition hit charts are much more forgiving compared to the wound charts, make sure not to get them confused. Unless the 9th age makes the hit chart the same as the wound chart? I’d have to go back and check. I’ll edit later.



Monster/chariot, etc:
Ridder and monster are one entity that has two statelines like a chariot. They use highest thoughness, add wound counts, use the same save and ward/regen save, (never better than 4+ for sanity sake) but they use two statelines when it is time to attack so a griffon would not benefit from the auto wound rule of the rider runefang or anything like that. This should help make them more durable, have a good punch when they attack, but not make them the invincible thing they are with End Times.


{And let's face it, 1+/3++ characters make troops pretty much irrelevant. Max the armor save out at 2+ and the ward at 4++ (or even 5++!) and even basic troops can hurt characters again. This is all the more important if you start combining profiles on monsters…}

I agree with armour saves, this would also help rank and file infantry against uber lords. If saving throws always fail on a 1, Can we max out armour saves at 2+?

Not every lord has a ward save at 2+, and all of them are more expensive. So instead of changing the best wardsave from 2+ to 3+, can we simply increase the cost of magic items that grant ward saves?
I like this, especially in rules where we have a parry save of 5+ instead of 6+.
Maybe allow parry save with magic weapon and mundane shield. I never understood why a magic weapon and a normal shield couldn’t be used to parry, when a mundane weapon and mundane shield could.

{With so many armies having the option to mount heroes/lords on chariots it's a shame you never see them. Simply use the highest t/w and add +2 to the armour save.}
I agree, treat them the same or similar to monster infantry.
I also think that reducing randomness is an important factor, so I prefer avoid randomising between the mount and chariot/munt when hitting.
