Credit due to all those who posted their suggestions, you know who you are.

My goal is to go through various forum threads, and aggregate them for easy reference so people aren’t double posting, and people don’t need to go through every post themselves.

Ideally, I’d use a service that lets people make public suggestions and inputs without making permanent changes to anything.

At least that’s the theory.

This is a community project with community input, I want to minimise how much I change the rules while I aggregate them. With one exception! For the sake of everyone, my aim is practicality and simpleness without dumbing things down. Warhammer is a game, and not a string of quantum physics equations.

Right now I’m mainly tackling:
