This resource and information repository is simply for making competition and balance changes to the game for the community especially after GW effectively abandoned it. The goal of this article is to allow people to make contributions and also permit people to see what everyone else wants to add or change without permanently losing the original core rules that the devs have set up. This is an imperfect solution, but permits everyone to participate and keep track of things without the creations of problems.

My goal is to go through various forum threads, and aggregate them for easy reference so people aren’t double posting, and people don’t need to go through every post themselves.

Ideally, I’d use a service that lets people make public suggestions and inputs without making permanent changes to anything.

At least that’s the theory.

This is a community project with community input, I want to minimise how much I change the rules while I aggregate them. With one exception! For the sake of everyone, my aim is practicality and simpleness without dumbing things down. Warhammer is a game, and not a string of quantum physics equations.

Right now I’m mainly tackling:
